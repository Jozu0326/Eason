# Refined 1:1 Plan

This is the core plan of my house. According to the study of 1:1plan on the first day, I found that the floor area of the core part was too large, which would make the overall area of the house too large and too long. Strip space is not conducive to space use and planning.I reduced its area to about ten square meters, so the area of the whole house might be a small house of 30 to 40 square meters. The toilet and kitchen space are shared, and the toilet is connected to the shower room, creating a small work and storage space. When the entire wall moves, the changes in the space on both sides are actually a mutual borrowing relationship. The total area is small on the basis of sufficient space for study and work.
