## Design Improvement

In the last discussion, the core is moved in two directions, and it has three modes of work, life, and party at the same time. Place the furniture that was originally placed on both sides on both sides of the core wall, such as the folding bed in the living area, the TV, the coffee table in the work area, the wall of picture frames and so on. All the functions of the house are concentrated on the core, so that the whole house becomes the two parts of the house frame and the core. Let the space become a free space and a core functional area. At the same time, the core continues to function as a space division and buffer zone.

## Digital Model Establishment

Build a 3D model based on the improved design.

## Furniture Research

The retractable toilet allows the toilet to be stored under the sink, saving space. Allows the lateral movement of the core to expand and contract to a smaller size.

The movable wall adopts slide rails and is electric, which is very suitable for my design.
