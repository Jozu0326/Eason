This is Eason (Xuanrun Yi), a architecture student from Wenzhou-Kean University.

I have been studying architecture for more than three years, and I have learned a lot from it. I believe that architecture is a discipline that integrates thinking and practice. While learning a lot of professional knowledge, it also gives rise to many aspects of sociology and philosophy of life. This time I think it is a very interesting challenge to build a low-cost and high-efficiency house for the people of Salt Lake City.
