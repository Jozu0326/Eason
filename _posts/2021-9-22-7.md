## Improve on the original basis

Red— 2 kitchen walls, but one full height units and it hides washing machine and cistern of toilet 

Blue— a wet room. This makes pod even smaller. 

Yellow— bookshelves or cabinets

Purple— doors. It will be sliding picket doors. And maybe some slide out to close room against outside walls.

# New Core Plan

Improved core plane based on the original sketch. This layout not only saves space and makes it simple and clear, but also creates a unified vertical acess while ensuring that the original core acts as a buffer zone for the entire space. The location of the shower room is close to the side of the living space. The door between the walls is composed of sliding doors or foldable doors, which allows the entire buffer belt to move in another direction while changing the space of the house.

The whole in one direction changes the ratio of the space on both sides. The movement of each wall in the other direction creates additional space, which enriches the functional space of the core tube. The function of the house is not only for work and study. The different proportions of the three walls can form a restaurant, a lodging area or a reading area. The movement between the walls can be changed according to needs, which makes the original small house more abundant.
