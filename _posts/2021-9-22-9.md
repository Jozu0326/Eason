## Structure Design

Because the volume of the house is very small, 5.5m*6.4m, according to the search, such columns with a distance of 20 cm or more on each side can well support the overall structure. In particular, the load-bearing effect of steel columns is better and more stable. So we plan to place four pillars on the four corners of the house, and the overall house is supported by a simple beam-column structure.

Another structural method is to place supporting structures such as pillars under the roof outside the house. In this way, the four walls of the house can open windows at will or use floor-to-ceiling glass windows. For example, Mies van der Rohe's classic Neue Nationalgalerie.

The lifting of the core part is to hide and prevent the horizontal water pipes, and the two sides do not directly touch the wall, leaving space for the water pipes to go down. Slide rails are distributed on both sides of the core for overall movement.g

## Start of Digital Modeling

According to the original plan, some optimizations have been made to reduce the original three passages into two, so that the core can more effectively separate and buffer the space. The passage for the first time is blocked by the bookshelf to add the functions of a work desk and a sofa.

Start to build some simple 3D models.

## Furniture Research

I want to hide all the furniture in the living area in the cabinet on the wall. In this way, the furniture can be stowed during the day, and the tables and chairs in the work area can be roller wheelchairs, so that the core part has more moving space.
### There is more space in the two areas of work and life that can be borrowed from each other, and the space becomes flexible. Only a small piece of overall space can be used to achieve two sufficient different types of space.
