## Client Positioning and Theme Determination

Self-made entrepreneurs (graduates), consulting industry for public welfare services (lawyers who provide public welfare services, psychological counselors)

They may need an affordable small house as a starting point for their entrepreneurship or a space to continue doing charity activities, with a space to work and live at the same time, and a working space to discuss or meet with customers at the same time.

Work and life are in the same space but relatively softly separated. In this way, there is a public space and a private space for meeting guests, and the separation of noise can be ensured.

## Basic Idea

Divide the plane of the house into three parts, a section from public to private at the other end, with working and living spaces at both ends. In the middle is a semi-open space. Facilities such as toilets and kitchens, which are used during work or rest, will be placed here to connect the spaces on both sides. It is more like a buffer zone, a relatively soft space isolation.

As shown in the figure, the slashed part is the buffer zone, which contains core spaces such as kitchens and toilets (spaces needed for work and life). It can be the central part of a space, dividing the space into two pieces. Or it is a basic part (example on the right), on which space (work and life) can be added. And the ratio can be changed according to requirements, such as different stages of entrepreneurship.

Section Proposal2

At the same time, the working and living spaces can be divided horizontally and vertically. For example, the first floor is a public space with a kitchen and work area, and the second floor is mainly a living space.
