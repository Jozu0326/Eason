## Client Positioning and Theme Determination

Self-made entrepreneurs (graduates), consulting industry for public welfare services (lawyers who provide public welfare services, psychological counselors)

They may need an affordable small house as a starting point for their entrepreneurship or a space to continue doing charity activities, with a space to work and live at the same time, and a working space to discuss or meet with customers at the same time.

Work and life are in the same space but relatively softly separated. In this way, there is a public space and a private space for meeting guests, and the separation of noise can be ensured.

## Basic Idea

Divide the plane of the house into three parts, a section from public to private at the other end, with working and living spaces at both ends. In the middle is a semi-open space. Facilities such as toilets and kitchens, which are used during work or rest, will be placed here to connect the spaces on both sides. It is more like a buffer zone, a relatively soft space isolation.
