## Plan Selection

From the three plans last time, a double-sided wall was used to divide the space in a simple horizontal space, so as to achieve a plan with relatively independent spaces on both sides. Among them, the double-sided wall can not only insulate noise, but also add functions that can be used in both sides of the space such as toilets and kitchens. In this way, the basic concept is formed: a simple space with three parts: a living area (private), a functional core area (communication) and a working area (public). It allows people to have both office and home status in a small house, relatively independent and close communication.

## Program Deepening

In the central core part, there are communal parts, hand washing area, toilet, and kitchen. There are parts belonging to the space on both sides, the shower room and laundry room close to the living area, and the storage room close to the working area.


## Technology

The picture shows a double-door elevator. It has a door on both sides. When the door on one side is opened, the other side will be locked. This allows a space to be used alone, such as a toilet.
