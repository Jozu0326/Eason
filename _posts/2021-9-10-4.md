### Simplify the Core Part

Considering the better expression of design concepts and spatial structure, as well as the problem of small house structure and engineering technology. Simplify the core part. A space wall is formed, the public communication part of the toilet and kitchen is in the middle, and the shower and darkroom spaces belong to the working and living spaces on both sides.

## Design Improvements

### Make the core part movable

The core part can move horizontally while serving as a space buffer, so that the space on both sides can be transformed. When you need to use one side of the space, move the core buffer to one side, so that the space on the side that is used becomes larger and the space on the side that is not used becomes smaller. For example, when you need to work and meet customers during the day, move the core buffer to the living area to expand the space of the work area, which can be used more comfortably, but the opposite is true at night. Such a proposed space, three parts, can be changed in different spaces within one day according to needs.

Two movable walls are installed in the center of the apartment, and the internal layout can be easily changed by rotating, from two bedrooms to one bedroom or a large activity space, depending on who lives here and what they want to be in Live in such an indoor environment and change freely.
