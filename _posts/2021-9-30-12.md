Typical Owner: There is a need for an affordable house and a need for work. Entrepreneurs without initial funds (emergency graduates) and social welfare consultants (rights lawyers, psychological consultants in public services).

### Take Salt Lake City as an example. In the social structure, a large number of people with housing difficulties come from young people who have no funds but still struggle for their dreams. They may be entrepreneurs without initial funds (emergency graduates), or ambitious social welfare consultants (rights lawyers, public service psychologists). Their housing needs are affordable (small space and low cost), and they have living and working space at the same time.

### A simple house is divided into two halves by using the core in the middle, namely work and life. Concentrate the functions of the house on the core and make it a part that can be used by the living space on both sides. This makes it the most active part, but also the partition and buffer zone of the entire space. Its movement can increase or decrease the space on one side, so that the space on both sides changes dynamically, and the working and living spaces present a dynamic relationship of mutual borrowing. Achieved the goal of having a small total house size, but with time dynamic changes and enough space for work or study. The horizontal contraction of the core creates a vast space and additional functions.
