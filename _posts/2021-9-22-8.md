### Drainage System Research

In view of the mobility of the inner core of the house, normal drainage pipes cannot meet the mobile drainage of the bathroom and kitchen. So I searched the drainage system of the RV as a reference.

A complete RV water system, including water supply and sewage treatment systems. It is mainly a clean water tank, a black water tank, and a gray water tank.

The function of the clean water tank is to store clean drinking water and domestic water. This is also the source of water for the RV.

The function of the gray water tank is to collect and treat domestic wastewater from the RV, such as the drainage of the wash basin and the ordinary drainage of the toilet.

The function of the black water tank is to store waste water and feces discharged from the toilet. In the black water tank, special degradants and deodorizers are generally added, which can better degrade solids and remove peculiar smells, and provide a beautiful environment for the RV.

When the waste water tank is full, the RV can drive to the drain with the sewer pipe to discharge the waste water. This can be applied to the mobile core to solve its drainage and water supply problems.

### Drainage System Design

Raise the core tube by a step to hide the parallel water pipes. At the same time, it also creates a sense of stepping up, echoing the buffering effect. The water pipes are pulled down on both sides of the house and connected to the water tank below the ground. The gray water tank and the black water tank move with the movement of the core part.

When the sewage of a day moves to the working area (on the side of the street) at night, the waste water tank is connected to the drainage system to discharge the waste water.
